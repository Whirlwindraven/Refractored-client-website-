# Refractored-client-website-

# Description 
In this project I had to create adjustments to the html file as well as the css file to maximize the SEO. The changes included creating div tags, creating section tags, creating nav tags, as well as adding a missing ID to correct for the inadquate nav tag that was not working (SEO). Additionally, changes made in the CSS where only to the purpose of compiling and cleaning code, no alterations or additions made.
